I am a statistics PhD candidate, completing a thesis on the use of linear mixed effects models for method comparison studies.
I am an epxerienced statistical programmer, and have several years of experience with R, SAS and SPSS.

Although a PhD student, I have lectured for several years in subjects related to R, MATLAB anbd SAS.
Recently I have begun to use Python and Julia also. I have given introductory talks on both for Python Ireland and Data Scientists Ireland.
Specifically my talks focussed on data manipulation, probability topics, and advanced statistical modelling.
(for example, modelling count variables)
I have also taken part in some online courses, such as Prof. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course. I really enjoyed it, and I hope
that this workshop will properly develop my skill set in this area.
