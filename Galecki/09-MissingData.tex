\subsection*{Missing Data in Method Comparison Studies}

The matter of missing data has not been commonly encountered in either Method Comparison Studies or Linear Mixed Effects Modelling. However Roy (2009) deals with the relevant assumptions regrading missing data.

Galecki \& Burzykowski (2013) approaches the subject of missing data in LME Modelling.

Furthermore the \textbf{\textit{nlmeU}} package includes the \texttt{patMiss} function, which ``allows to compactly present pattern of missing data in a given vector/matrix/data
frame or combination of thereof".
