the $J$ method is compared a simulated data setn constructed whereby some added to random noise $(\mathca{N}(0,1)$


To demonstrate the case whereby only within-item variance is the source of disagfreement, we simply subtract the intermethod bias estimate from the $S$ measurement and respear the procediure
