\subsection{Computation with \texttt{R}} 

When tackling linear mixed effects models
using the R language, a statistician can call upon the \emph{lme}
command found in the \emph{nlme} package.This command fits a LME
model to the data set using either Maximum Likelihood (ML) or
Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML).

The first two arguments for \emph{lme} are \emph{fixed} and
\emph{data}, which give the model for the expected responses (i.e.
the fixed part of the model), and the data that the model should
be fitted from. The next argument is  \emph{random}, a one-sided
formula which describes the random effects, and the grouping
structure for the model. The  \emph{method} argument can specify
whether to use 'REML', the default setting, or 'ML'.
